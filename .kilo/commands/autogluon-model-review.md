description: "Iterative audit skill for ZINC Fusion V16 AutoGluon training pipeline. Use when: reviewing model config, auditing pipeline scaffold, checking training gate enforcement, verifying specialist/horizon structure, diagnosing AutoGluon gotchas, assessing Phase 5 readiness, or validating python/fusion/. Runs pre-checks, sequential section loop, resolution loop, and commit/push gate. Never trains models or promotes data. For indicator math correctness and overtooling review, use indicator-review skill instead."
