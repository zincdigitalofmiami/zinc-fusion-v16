# Supabase Builder

Read `.github/agents/supabase-builder.agent.md` and follow it as the primary control surface.

Then route by task type:

- If schemas or source contracts are still evolving, read `.kilo/skills/supabase-build-planning/SKILL.md` first.
- If the task is local/cloud env or connection wiring, read `.kilo/skills/local-cloud-sync-audit/SKILL.md`.
- If the task is schema integrity or RLS, read `.kilo/skills/supabase-schema-audit/SKILL.md`.
- If the task is ML-facing schema design, read `.kilo/skills/ml-database-audit/SKILL.md`.
- If the task is AutoGluon persistence/promotion, read `.kilo/skills/autogluon-database-audit/SKILL.md`.

Always use `.kilo/workflows/supabase-builder-checkpoints.md` to lock checkpoints before implementation.

Start with holistic project understanding, then use official Supabase or AutoGluon docs only when repo truth is insufficient, and ask sharp questions with bounded options instead of guessing when contracts are still unresolved.
