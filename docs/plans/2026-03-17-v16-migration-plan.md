## 1. Principles

### What V16 Is

- A from-scratch rebuild — **no code transferred from legacy baseline**
- legacy baseline stays live as reference and rollback during the entire build
- legacy baseline is a reference for _what the product does_, not a source of code to port
- Purpose: eliminate all drift, errors, mismatches, legacy baggage, Inngest complexity

### What V16 Is Not

- Not a migration-in-place
- Not a refactor of legacy baseline
- Not a copy-paste with cleanup
- Not allowed to inherit: the old Prisma migration chain, copied `.vercel/` state, hand-copied `.env.local` habits, the Inngest estate, dead pages, dead jobs, or unclear contracts

### Non-Negotiable Rules

1. No old migration history crosses the boundary
2. Every table must have a reader AND a writer
3. Every page must justify its data dependencies
4. Every job must justify its existence
5. Start from the screen, not the schema
6. Rewrite the chart from scratch using legacy baseline as visual reference — settings were hard-won, preserve behavior exactly
7. Rewrite the landing page from scratch using legacy baseline as visual reference — specific and intentional design to preserve
8. ProFarmer is mandatory ($500/month)
9. 11 specialists — never 10. `trump_effect` is the 11th.
10. Target = future price level. Target Zones = horizontal lines. Never cones, bands, or funnels.

### Primary Users & Their Needs

| User                                                                        | Need                                                 | V16 Surface                                       |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Chris** (owner, US Oil Solutions — BUYS raw soybean oil by the trainload) | Know where ZL price is heading to time purchases     | Dashboard chart + Target Zones + Strategy posture |
| **Chris**                                                                   | Understand what's driving price                      | Top 4 Drivers, Regime state, Specialist signals   |

| **Both**                                                                    | Policy/legislation impact on soy oil                 | Legislation page                                  |
| **Both**                                                                    | Market sentiment read                                | Sentiment page                                    |

### V16 Page Surface (6 pages — Quant dropped)

1. **`/`** — Landing page (rewrite from scratch using legacy baseline as visual reference — ZERO code copied, ZERO mock data)
2. **`/dashboard`** — ZL candlestick chart (rewrite from scratch using legacy baseline as visual reference) + Target Zones + live price + regime + drivers + cards
3. **`/strategy`** — Posture recommendation, contract impact calculator, factor waterfall (keep content, redesign layout)
4. **`/legislation`** — Federal Register / policy tracking (clean rebuild)
5. **`/sentiment`** — News sentiment, CoT positioning, narrative (keep first 3-4 rows)
6. **`/vegas-intel`** — Restaurant/casino event intelligence (keep ALL content, better layout — events = everything)

### Critical Data Contracts

| Contract                  | Powers                                | Freshness             |

| Vegas operations          | Vegas Intel page                      | Event-driven          |

### What Dies (legacy baseline baggage that does NOT cross)

- 34 Prisma migrations
- 104 Inngest functions (replaced by pg_cron + http extension + Python workers)
- Docker Inngest local dev container and healing scripts
- Duplicate/overlapping data ingestion jobs
- Dead tables (`eia_biodiesel_1w` with 0 rows, `uco_prices_1w` with 0 rows)
- Tables with no reader (orphaned)
- `inngest_receipts` table
- Quant page (dropped)
- The entire `.vercel/` state
- Manual `.env.local` habits
- Over-normalized Vegas tables (17 → 7)
- ProFarmer Docker complexity (rebuilt as Python Playwright)

### Cloud Supabase ONLY — No Local Supabase, No Docker

| Scenario                      | Approach                                                                                                                                                  | Why                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend dev**              | Reads from cloud Supabase                                                                                                                                 | Single source of truth. No local/cloud drift. `vercel env pull` provides connection.                                                                  |
| **Python training/inference** | Reads raw data from cloud Supabase (canonical). Writes intermediates to **local parquet files** during compute. Promotes validated outputs back to cloud. | Cloud is canonical. Local is a compute workspace — intermediates stay local during iteration. Only validated artifacts are promoted back to cloud DB. |
| **Data ingestion**            | Runs **INSIDE Postgres** via pg_cron + http extension                                                                                                     | No Vercel cron routes. No external orchestrator. Ingestion is a database-native operation.                                                            |
| **Supabase CLI**              | Used for migrations ONLY (`supabase db push`, `supabase db diff --linked`)                                                                                | No `supabase start`. No local Docker containers. No local Postgres.                                                                                   |

**Guard rail:** Create a `training` Postgres role that can only write to `training.*` and `forecasts.*` schemas. The Python pipeline uses this role. Frontend service role is read-only on those schemas.

### Cloud-Canonical Data Contract

| Layer                                                             | Canonical Location          | Notes                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Raw ingest tables (mkt, econ, alt, supply)                        | **Cloud Supabase**          | pg_cron + http writes directly to cloud                      |
| Serving tables (analytics, forecasts.target_zones)                | **Cloud Supabase**          | Dashboard reads from cloud                                   |
| Published forecasts / Target Zones                                | **Cloud Supabase**          | Pre-computed, served to chart                                |
| Training metadata (model_registry, training_runs)                 | **Cloud Supabase**          | Registry of what was trained and when                        |
| Ops observability (ingest_run, pipeline_alerts)                   | **Cloud Supabase**          | All logging in cloud                                         |
| Wide intermediate artifacts (feature matrix, specialist parquets) | **Local compute workspace** | Parquet files during processing only — not canonical storage |
| Model artifacts (AutoGluon model files)                           | **Local compute workspace** | Large binary artifacts, not in any database                  |

**Training data storage architecture** (whether wide training artifacts should be retained locally vs promoted to cloud `training.*` tables) is a separate checkpoint decision, still gated. Current posture: cloud Supabase `training.*` tables exist and are the intended destination for `promote_to_cloud.py`. Local parquet files are ephemeral compute intermediates.

### Cron-First Ingestion Contract

All data ingestion runs inside Supabase Postgres via pg_cron + http extension. No ingestion readiness can be claimed until:

1. **Functions exist** — plpgsql ingestion functions are deployed via migration
2. **Cron jobs are registered** — `SELECT count(*) FROM cron.job` returns expected schedule count
3. **First successful run** — each function has at least one `status = 'ok'` row in `ops.ingest_run`
4. **Vault keys are stored** — `current_setting('app.<key>')` returns non-null for all configured sources

**Current state (as of planning):** `cron.job` has 0 entries. Extensions pg_cron, http, pg_net are enabled. No ingestion functions exist. This is an explicit blocker for Gate 4.

## 4. Schema Design (9 Schemas)

**Design note:** `news_events` consolidates legacy baseline's separate tables (`econ_news`, `policy_news`, `cbp_trade`, `aei_trade`, `farmdoc_rins`, `fas_news`, `esmis_publications`, `biofuel_policy`) into a single table with a `source` column and `specialist_tags[]` array. This is cleaner — one table to query for the sentiment page, filterable by source or tag.

**Consolidated from legacy baseline's 17 tables.** V16 drops over-normalized structure (`shifts`, `shift_casinos`, `shift_restaurants`, `cuisine_affinity`, `cuisine_match`, `event_labels`, `event_entities`, `event_profiles`, `daily_spend`) and uses fewer tables with richer JSON columns where appropriate.

### Tier A: pg_cron + http Extension (~22 plpgsql Functions)

legacy baseline had 104 fragmented Inngest functions. V16 consolidates to ~22 plpgsql functions triggered by pg_cron, running entirely inside Postgres via the `http` extension. No Vercel cron routes. No external orchestrator. FRED is split into `ingest_fred_core()` (chart-critical minimum, Phase 4) and `ingest_fred_catalog()` (full expansion, Phase 6). Databento functions stay separate — different symbol sets, different failure domains (see checkpoint-4-job-architecture.md).

**API keys** are stored in Supabase Vault and accessed via `current_setting()` inside plpgsql functions.

**Consolidation map:**

### Tier D: ProFarmer — Special Handling

ProFarmer is $500/month and mandatory. Requires a headless browser.

**V16 approach:** Rebuild as a Python script using Playwright, triggered by system cron on the local/dev machine. Writes directly to cloud Supabase. Falls back to GitHub Actions scheduled workflow for redundancy if local machine is offline.

| Aspect     | legacy baseline                              | V16                                   |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Runtime    | Puppeteer-extra (Node.js) via Docker Inngest | Playwright (Python) via system cron   |
| Hosting    | Docker container on local machine            | Direct Python script on local machine |
| Fallback   | None (if Docker down, no scraping)           | GitHub Actions scheduled workflow     |
| Browser    | System Chrome via `resolveChromePath()`      | Playwright-managed Chromium           |
| Complexity | 23 serverExternalPackages, healing scripts   | Single Python script, no Docker       |

### Ingestion Auth Pattern

pg_cron functions run **inside Postgres** as the `postgres` role — no external HTTP auth needed. No CRON_SECRET. No Vercel cron routes to protect.

API keys for external data sources (Databento, FRED, etc.) are stored in **Supabase Vault** and accessed inside plpgsql functions via `current_setting('app.databento_api_key')` etc. Keys never leave the database boundary.

## 6. API Surface

### Read Routes (dashboard-facing, ~15 routes)

| Route                     | Returns                                                  | Source Table(s)                                               |

| `/api/zl/live`            | Latest price + timestamp                                 | mkt.latest_price                                              |
| `/api/zl/target-zones`    | P30/P50/P70 zone data for chart overlay                  | forecasts.target_zones                                        |

| `/api/dashboard/metrics`  | Pre-computed dashboard stats                             | analytics.dashboard_metrics                                   |

### Data Ingestion (pg_cron — NOT Vercel routes)

All data ingestion runs as pg_cron + http plpgsql functions inside Supabase. No Vercel cron routes exist. See Section 5 Tier A for the current list of ~22 pg_cron functions.

### Auth Routes

| Route                | Purpose                |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `/api/auth/callback` | Supabase Auth callback |
| `/api/auth/check`    | Session validation     |

### Dropped from legacy baseline

- `/api/zl/brief` — fold into forecast
- `/api/zl/context` — fold into dashboard metrics
- `/api/zl/raw` — unnecessary
- `/api/zl/chart` — redundant with price-1d
- `/api/zl/price-5m` — unnecessary granularity
- `/api/policy/section-brief` — merge into legislation feed
- `/api/refresh-drivers` — drivers refresh via cron
- `/api/epu` — fold into dashboard metrics
- `/api/weather-risk` — fold into dashboard
- `/api/quant/overview` — quant page dropped

---

## 7. Auth & Security Model

### legacy baseline Problem

Custom cookie-based auth with unclear RLS enforcement. Service-role key used for all DB reads, bypassing Supabase RLS policies. No clear separation between public reads and admin writes.

### V16 Auth Design

**Two access tiers:**

| Tier                                    | Who                             | Supabase Key       | Can Do                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Dashboard user** (Chris, Kevin)       | Authenticated via Supabase Auth | `anon` key + JWT   | Read all dashboard-facing tables via API routes |
| **System** (cron jobs, Python pipeline) | Service role                    | `service_role` key | Write to all tables, bypasses RLS               |

### RLS Strategy

| Schema                         | RLS | Policy                                                                         |
| ------------------------------ | --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `mkt`, `econ`, `alt`, `supply` | ON  | `SELECT` for authenticated users, `INSERT/UPDATE` for service_role only        |
| `training`, `forecasts`        | ON  | `SELECT` for authenticated users, `INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE` for service_role only |
| `analytics`                    | ON  | `SELECT` for authenticated users, writes only from pg_cron or service_role     |
| `ops`                          | ON  | `SELECT` for service_role only (not user-facing)                               |
| `vegas`                        | ON  | `SELECT` for authenticated users, writes for service_role                      |

### API Route Auth Pattern

```
Browser -> /api/zl/price-1d -> middleware checks Supabase session cookie
  -> if valid: query with supabase client (respects RLS)
  -> if not: 401

pg_cron -> ingest_fred_core() / ingest_fred_catalog() plpgsql functions -> run inside Postgres as postgres role
  -> no external auth needed, access API keys via Supabase Vault
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable                        | Source               | Used By                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`      | Supabase integration | Browser client                                                 |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase integration | Browser client                                                 |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`     | Supabase integration | Server-side routes, cron                                       |
| `DATABASE_URL`                  | Supabase integration | Python pipeline (psycopg2 direct, port 5432)                   |
| `DATABASE_POOLER_URL`           | Supabase integration | Python short reads (port 6543)                                 |
| _(API keys in Vault)_           | Supabase Vault       | pg_cron ingestion functions access via `current_setting()`     |
| `DATABENTO_API_KEY`             | Supabase Vault       | pg_cron ingestion functions (accessed via `current_setting()`) |
| `FRED_API_KEY`                  | Supabase Vault       | pg_cron ingestion functions (accessed via `current_setting()`) |
| `PROFARMER_*`                   | Local env only       | ProFarmer scraper (never on Vercel)                            |

### Security Rules

1. No `service_role` key exposed to browser — ever
2. All browser reads go through API routes with JWT/session validation
3. `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars contain only anon key and URL — no secrets
4. Python pipeline uses direct connection (port 5432) for bulk writes — not pooler
5. ProFarmer credentials never deployed to Vercel
6. No manual `.env` copying — all env management through Vercel integration + `vercel env pull`

## 8. Python Pipeline Rebuild

### Pipeline Phases

```
Phase 1: Data Ingestion     <-- pg_cron + http extension handles this (not Python)
Phase 2: Feature Assembly    <-- build_matrix.py
Phase 3: Specialist Features <-- generate_specialist_features.py
Phase 4: Specialist Signals  <-- generate_specialist_signals.py
Phase 5: Core Training       <-- train_models.py (AutoGluon, 3 horizons: 30d/90d/180d)
Phase 6: Forward Inference   <-- generate_forward_forecasts.py
Phase 7: Monte Carlo         <-- run_monte_carlo.py (10,000 runs)
Phase 8: GARCH               <-- run_garch.py
Phase 9: Post-Processing     <-- generate_target_zones.py (NEW)
```

### What Changes from legacy baseline

| Aspect                  | legacy baseline                                   | V16                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DB connection**       | psycopg2 -> Prisma Postgres                       | psycopg2 -> Supabase Postgres (direct for writes, pooler for reads)             |
| **Config**              | Scattered across modules                          | Single `config.py` with frozen model zoo, schema constants                      |
| **Matrix builder**      | 1,487 features, accumulated drift columns         | Clean rebuild — only features with a reader. Intentional count.                 |
| **Specialist features** | 11 buckets, some with ffill bugs, EIA zeros       | 11 buckets, clean loaders, explicit null policy per source                      |
| **Model artifacts**     | `models/core_v2/{horizon}d/` local files          | Same local structure, `model_registry` in Supabase tracks promotions            |
| **Forward inference**   | Two scripts existed (old OOF-based + new forward) | Single `generate_forward_forecasts.py` — forward only                           |
| **Target Zones**        | Derived on-the-fly in API routes                  | Pre-computed by `generate_target_zones.py`, written to `forecasts.target_zones` |
| **Package manager**     | uv                                                | uv (keep)                                                                       |
| **Testing**             | pytest with ~16% coverage                         | pytest — rebuild tests alongside pipeline                                       |

### New Script: `generate_target_zones.py`

legacy baseline scattered Target Zone computation across API routes and Monte Carlo outputs. V16 has a dedicated post-processing step:

```
Reads:  forecasts.production_1d + forecasts.monte_carlo_runs + forecasts.garch_forecasts
Computes: P30/P50/P70 price levels per horizon
Writes: forecasts.target_zones (serving table)
Dashboard reads: forecasts.target_zones directly -- no on-the-fly computation
```

### Pipeline Runner

```bash
# Full pipeline
python -m fusion.pipeline run --all

# Individual phases
python -m fusion.pipeline run --phase matrix
python -m fusion.pipeline run --phase specialists
python -m fusion.pipeline run --phase train
python -m fusion.pipeline run --phase forecast
python -m fusion.pipeline run --phase monte-carlo
python -m fusion.pipeline run --phase target-zones

# Dry run (shows what would happen, no writes)
python -m fusion.pipeline run --all --dry-run
```

### Connection Strategy

```
Cloud Supabase connection string:
  Direct (port 5432): for long training writes — no pooler timeout
  Pooled (port 6543): for short reads/queries

Env vars:
  SUPABASE_DB_URL       = direct connection
  SUPABASE_POOLER_URL   = pooled connection
```

### Data Posture

Cloud Supabase is canonical for all stored data. The Python pipeline is a compute client:

- **Reads:** from cloud Supabase (canonical source) via psycopg2
- **Computes:** locally — all feature engineering, training, forecasting, simulation runs on local machine
- **Intermediates:** local parquet files — ephemeral compute artifacts, not canonical storage
- **Promotes:** validated compact outputs back to cloud Supabase via `promote_to_cloud.py`

Training data storage architecture (whether wide training artifacts like `training.matrix_1d` should be retained in cloud or live only as local parquet) is a separate checkpoint decision. Current design: `promote_to_cloud.py` pushes to cloud `training.*` tables. This may be refined under a future checkpoint.

### Training Gate (carried from legacy baseline — still mandatory)

**NEVER start model training without explicit user approval.** The pipeline runner has a `--dry-run` flag. Training writes are gated behind a confirmation prompt.

### Model Architecture (unchanged conceptually)

- **L0 Core:** 3 AutoGluon TimeSeriesPredictor ensembles (30d/90d/180d), each training 19-model zoo
- **Target:** Future ZL futures contract price (`close.shift(-horizon)`), columns named `target_price_{h}d`
- **Metric:** MAE (point forecast accuracy)
- **Output:** Single `predicted_price` per horizon
- **Covariates:** All OBSERVED (no known future values)
- **Validation:** 4 expanding windows
- **Frequency:** Business day (`B`)
- **L2/L3:** Calibration + Monte Carlo wraps price prediction with probability -> Target Zones

### Big-11 Specialists (unchanged conceptually)

| Bucket       | Model Type  | Signal Contract                       |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| crush        | GBM         | Crush margin z-score + momentum       |
| china        | GBM         | Demand outlook + Brazil competition   |
| substitutes  | RF          | Substitution pressure + richness      |
| fx           | ARDL        | FX pressure index + carry             |
| fed          | Ridge       | Rates regime + change                 |
| tariff       | Rule-based  | Tariff risk + EPU spike               |
| energy       | VAR         | Energy spillover + momentum           |
| biofuel      | NLP + EMA   | Policy pressure + trend               |
| palm         | ECM + Ridge | Cointegration + mean reversion        |

## 9. Frontend Wireframe

### Shell: shadcn/ui + Radix + Tailwind CSS

shadcn/ui provides the component primitives. V16 builds the dashboard shell from scratch — sidebar nav, header bar, content area, responsive layout — using shadcn/ui components with ZINC Fusion brand tokens.

### Page Map (6 pages)

```
/                   -> Landing page (rewrite from scratch, legacy baseline visual reference)
/dashboard          -> Main dashboard (rewrite chart + cards from scratch, shadcn/ui shell)
/strategy           -> Strategy posture (keep content, redesign layout)
/legislation        -> Legislation tracking (clean rebuild)
/sentiment          -> News + CoT (keep first 3-4 rows)
/vegas-intel        -> Vegas operations (keep ALL, better layout)
```

### Landing Page (`/`)

**Directive: REWRITE FROM SCRATCH using legacy baseline as visual reference only — ZERO code copied.** The legacy baseline landing page design is specific and intentional. V16 reproduces it faithfully inside the shadcn/ui public (non-authenticated) shell. ZERO mock data.

**Elements to preserve exactly:**

- Hero composition with headline + proof + CTA
- NeuralSphere or equivalent premium visual
- Product module cards
- Trust/proof strip (horizons, specialists, update SLA)
- Method section narrative
- Logo + brand identity
- Typography and spacing intent

**Layout reference:**

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| Top Nav: logo | product | methodology | access | CTA         |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| Hero:                                                        |
| Left: headline + proof + CTA                                 |
| Right: live chart teaser / animated data object              |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| Trust / proof strip: horizons | specialists | update SLA     |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| Product modules: Dashboard | Strategy | Policy | Intel       |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| Method section: How the intelligence stack works             |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| CTA / Footer                                                 |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Dashboard (`/dashboard`)

**Directive: REWRITE chart from scratch using legacy baseline as visual reference — ZERO code copied, ZERO mock data. Keep cards.**

## 10. Evaluation Gates & Quality Checks

### Gate 1: Supabase Foundation Verification

**Before any feature work:**

| Check                                                    | Evidence Required                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Supabase project created and reachable                   | `supabase status` returns healthy                               |
| Cloud Supabase reachable from local machine              | `psql` connection test succeeds against cloud Supabase          |
| Vercel <> Supabase integration active                    | Env vars auto-populated in Vercel project settings              |
| `vercel env pull` works in V16 repo                      | `.env.local` generated with correct Supabase keys               |
| DB health route responds                                 | `GET /api/health` returns `{ ok: true }` from local and preview |
| Direct psycopg2 connection from Python                   | Connection test passes against cloud Supabase                   |
| V16 repo is NOT linked to legacy baseline Vercel project | `vercel ls` shows only `zinc-fusion-v16`                        |

### Gate 2: Schema Integrity

**After schema creation, before any writes:**

| Check                                            | Evidence Required             |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| All 9 schemas exist                              | `\dn` in psql lists exactly 9 |
| Every table has a primary key                    | No heap-only tables           |
| Every table has `created_at` timestamp           | Audit trail                   |
| Every table with external data has `ingested_at` | Freshness tracking            |
| Every table referenced by an API route exists    | Route -> table trace complete |
| No orphan tables (no reader AND no writer)       | Full dependency map           |
| RLS enabled on all tables                        | `rowsecurity = true` for all  |
| Indexes on all date/symbol columns               | `\di` confirms indexes        |

### Gate 3: Auth & Security Verification

| Check                                                            | Evidence Required                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| API keys stored in Supabase Vault                                | Vault entries confirmed for all external data sources       |
| All pg_cron ingestion functions use `current_setting()` for keys | Code review of each plpgsql function                        |
| No `service_role` key in browser-accessible code                 | Grep for key in client components = 0 results               |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars contain only anon key and URL               | No secrets in public vars                                   |
| RLS policies block unauthenticated reads                         | Test: anon request without JWT -> rejected                  |
| Supabase Auth callback route works                               | Login -> callback -> session -> authenticated read succeeds |
| Python pipeline uses direct connection for bulk writes           | Connection string check                                     |

### Gate 4A: Cron Readiness Preflight (NEW — blocks Gate 4)

**Before any Gate 4 claim, cron infrastructure must be verified:**

| Check                                            | SQL Validation                                                                                                      | Evidence Required                |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |

| http extension enabled                           | `SELECT count(*) FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'http'` = 1                                                      | Extension active                 |
| Ingestion functions exist                        | `SELECT count(*) FROM pg_proc WHERE proname LIKE 'ingest_%'` ≥ expected count                                       | Functions deployed via migration |
| Cron jobs registered                             | `SELECT count(*) FROM cron.job` ≥ Phase 4 expected schedule count                                                   | Schedules active                 |
| No duplicate job names                           | `SELECT jobname, count(*) FROM cron.job GROUP BY jobname HAVING count(*) > 1` = 0 rows                              | No duplicates                    |
| No duplicate function names                      | `SELECT proname, count(*) FROM pg_proc WHERE proname LIKE 'ingest_%' GROUP BY proname HAVING count(*) > 1` = 0 rows | No duplicates                    |
| Vault keys stored                                | `SELECT current_setting('app.databento_api_key') IS NOT NULL` (repeat per source)                                   | Keys accessible                  |
| At least one successful run per Phase 4 function | `SELECT DISTINCT job_name FROM ops.ingest_run WHERE status = 'ok'` ⊇ Phase 4 functions                              | First-success evidence           |

**Preflight SQL block (run before claiming Gate 4):**

```sql
-- 1. Extension check
SELECT extname FROM pg_extension WHERE extname IN ('pg_cron', 'http', 'pg_net');

-- 2. Schedule density
SELECT count(*) AS total_jobs FROM cron.job;

-- 3. Duplicate job name audit
SELECT jobname, count(*) FROM cron.job GROUP BY jobname HAVING count(*) > 1;

-- 4. Duplicate function name audit
SELECT proname, count(*) FROM pg_proc
WHERE proname LIKE 'ingest_%' AND pronamespace = 'public'::regnamespace
GROUP BY proname HAVING count(*) > 1;

-- 5. Critical source health (staleness per table)
SELECT 'mkt.price_1d' AS tbl, max(bucket_ts) AS latest, now() - max(bucket_ts) AS age FROM mkt.price_1d
UNION ALL
SELECT 'mkt.latest_price', max(updated_at), now() - max(updated_at) FROM mkt.latest_price
UNION ALL
SELECT 'econ.rates_1d', max(observation_date), now() - max(observation_date)::timestamp FROM econ.rates_1d;

-- 6. Vault key accessibility
SELECT current_setting('app.databento_api_key', true) IS NOT NULL AS databento_key_set,
       current_setting('app.fred_api_key', true) IS NOT NULL AS fred_key_set;

-- 7. First-success evidence
SELECT job_name, min(started_at) AS first_success
FROM ops.ingest_run WHERE status = 'ok' GROUP BY job_name;

-- 8. Duplicate ingested row check (example for price_1d)
SELECT symbol, bucket_ts, count(*) FROM mkt.price_1d
GROUP BY symbol, bucket_ts HAVING count(*) > 1;
```

**Gate 4A MUST pass before Gate 4 can be claimed.** If `cron.job` is empty, Gate 4 is blocked regardless of function existence.

### Gate 4: Data Flow Verification (requires Gate 4A)

### Phase 1: Schema & Seed

**Entry:** Phase 0 complete.

| Step | Action                                                                            | Exit Evidence                         |

**Exit criteria:** All tables exist, RLS active, indexes created, Gate 2 passes.

### Phase 1.5: Page Rewrites

**Entry:** Phase 1 complete. All schemas and tables exist.

All 6 pages are rewritten from scratch using legacy baseline as **VISUAL reference only**. ZERO code copied from legacy baseline. ZERO mock data — pages render in empty state until data is wired in later phases.

| Step  | Action                                                                                        | Exit Evidence                               |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 1.5.1 | Rewrite Landing page from scratch (legacy baseline is visual reference ONLY — no code copied) | Page renders in empty/placeholder state     |
| 1.5.2 | Rewrite Dashboard page from scratch (chart component, cards, status bar)                      | Page renders with empty state, no mock data |
| 1.5.3 | Rewrite Strategy page from scratch                                                            | Page renders with empty state               |
| 1.5.4 | Rewrite Legislation page from scratch                                                         | Page renders with empty state               |
| 1.5.5 | Rewrite Sentiment page from scratch                                                           | Page renders with empty state               |
| 1.5.6 | Rewrite Vegas Intel page from scratch                                                         | Page renders with empty state               |

**Rules:**

- ZERO code copied from legacy baseline — every line written fresh
- ZERO mock data — components show empty/loading states
- legacy baseline is studied for visual design and UX patterns only
- Data wiring happens in Phase 2 (chart), Phase 7 (dashboard), Phase 8 (secondary pages)

**Exit criteria:** All 6 pages render cleanly in empty state. No legacy baseline code present. No mock data.

### Phase 2: Read Path — Chart & Live Price

**Entry:** Phase 1 complete. This is the most critical phase — if the chart doesn't work, nothing else matters.

| 2.11 | Parity check: legacy baseline chart vs V16 chart side-by-side                                             | Visually identical                                 |

**Exit criteria:** Chart renders identically to legacy baseline with real historical data. Live price route works. Cards render.

### Phase 3: Landing Page

**Entry:** Phase 2 complete (chart works).

| Step | Action                                                                                                                                                             | Exit Evidence                             |

**Exit criteria:** Landing page is visually faithful to legacy baseline. CTA leads to dashboard.

### Phase 4A: Cron Infrastructure Preflight (NEW — before Phase 4)

**Entry:** Phase 2 complete. Extensions enabled (verified in CP1). Vault keys not yet stored. cron.job empty.

This phase establishes cron readiness before any ingestion function is built. No runtime ingestion claims until this phase exits cleanly.

| Step | Action                                                                     | Exit Evidence                                                                            |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| 4A.3 | Verify http extension can make outbound calls                              | Test `SELECT http_get('https://httpbin.org/get')` succeeds inside a plpgsql block        |
| 4A.4 | Create `ops.ingest_run` logging pattern (if not already present)           | Logging table and insert function verified                                               |
| 4A.5 | Run Gate 4A preflight SQL block                                            | All checks pass (extensions present, vault keys accessible, no duplicate names)          |

**Exit criteria:** Vault keys stored, extensions operational, Gate 4A preflight passes. Phase 4 can begin.

### Phase 4: Data Ingestion — Critical pg_cron Functions

**Entry:** Phase 4A complete (cron infrastructure verified). Chart needs fresh data, not just seed data.

All data ingestion is implemented as plpgsql functions using pg_cron + http extension inside Supabase. No Vercel cron routes. No vercel.json cron config. API keys stored in Supabase Vault.

| Step | Action                                                                                                                               | Exit Evidence                                              |

**Exit criteria:** Chart shows today's data. Core market tables updating on schedule via pg_cron. `ingest_fred_core()` feeding chart-critical FRED series. Freshness monitoring active. Gate 4A re-verified with registered jobs. No Vercel cron routes. `cron.job` count matches expected Phase 4 schedule density.

### Phase 5: Python Pipeline Rebuild

**Entry:** Phase 4 complete (data flowing into Supabase).

Python pipeline writes all intermediates to **LOCAL FILES** (parquet). Only validated outputs are promoted to cloud Supabase via `promote_to_cloud.py`. This prevents half-baked training artifacts from polluting the production database.

| Step | Action                                                                                                            | Exit Evidence                                                                           |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5.1  | Rebuild `config.py` — frozen model zoo, schema constants, DB URLs, local output paths                             | Config loads cleanly                                                                    |
| 5.2  | Rebuild `build_matrix.py` — reads from cloud Supabase, writes `data/matrix_1d.parquet` locally                    | Local parquet has rows with expected column count                                       |
| 5.3  | Rebuild specialist feature generators (all 11) — writes `data/specialist_features_*.parquet` locally              | Local parquet files populated for each bucket                                           |

| 5.10 | Build NEW `promote_to_cloud.py` — reads local parquet, validates, pushes to cloud Supabase                        | Promotion gate: validates row counts, schema match, null checks before writing to cloud |
| 5.11 | Rebuild `pipeline.py` runner (orchestrates all phases including promotion)                                        | `python -m fusion.pipeline run --all` completes end-to-end                              |
| 5.12 | Run promotion gate — validate local outputs, promote to cloud                                                     | Cloud tables populated with validated data                                              |
| 5.13 | Run Gate 5 (Python Pipeline Verification)                                                                         | All checks pass                                                                         |

| **R3**  | Supabase connection pooler timeouts during Python training writes     | Medium     | High           | Use direct connection (port 5432) for bulk writes, not pooler. Set `statement_timeout`.                                                                                               |

| **R5**  | Specialist feature generators produce different signals after rebuild | Medium     | High           | Validate V16 outputs against legacy baseline outputs row-by-row before training.                                                                                                      |
| **R6**  | AutoGluon model performance degrades on clean matrix                  | Medium     | Medium         | Expected — clean matrix has different features. Retrain and evaluate. Dry run first.                                                                                                  |

| **R11** | pg_cron function timeout or http extension response limits            | Low        | Medium         | pg_cron runs inside Postgres with configurable timeout. http extension handles standard REST APIs. ProFarmer stays as external Python scraper.                                        |
| **R12** | Env variable mismatch between environments                            | Low        | Low            | Vercel <> Supabase integration. `vercel env pull` for local. No manual .env copying.                                                                                                  |
| **R13** | Cron jobs not registered — ingestion claimed but not running          | Medium     | **Critical**   | Gate 4A blocks all ingestion claims until `cron.job` has expected entries and first-success evidence exists in `ops.ingest_run`. Never claim ingestion readiness before registration. |
| **R14** | FRED core/catalog split misses chart-critical series                  | Low        | High           | `ingest_fred_core()` explicitly includes rates, vol indices, inflation, activity, crude, tallow PPI. Catalog expansion deferred to Phase 6 — does not block chart rendering.          |

## 13. Highest-Value Validation Steps

Run these first — they reveal architectural problems fastest:

1. **Does Phase 4A verify cron readiness and first successful writes before claiming data readiness?** If `cron.job` is empty or no function has a successful `ops.ingest_run` entry, all downstream ingestion claims are false. Run the Gate 4A preflight SQL block.
2. **Can Python connect to cloud Supabase and write a row?** If this fails, the entire training pipeline design is blocked.
3. **Does the chart render with seeded data from Supabase?** If this fails, the core product is broken.
4. **Does a single pg_cron + http plpgsql function fire, fetch data, and write to a table?** If this fails, the entire ingestion architecture is wrong.
5. **Does Supabase Auth work with the shadcn/ui shell?** If this fails, the auth design needs rework.
6. **Can `build_matrix.py` read from Supabase and assemble features?** If this fails, the Python <> Supabase data flow needs debugging.
7. **Does `check_freshness()` detect and alert on stale data?** Simulate a stale source and verify `ops.pipeline_alerts` fires. This must work before Gate 4/Gate 5 claims.

## 14. Dependency-Aware Remediation Sequence

If something breaks, fix in this order (upstream first):

```
Supabase connectivity
  -> Schema correctness
    -> RLS policies
      -> Seed data
        -> Chart rendering (MOST CRITICAL)
          -> Cron routes (ZL daily first)
            -> FRED/macro crons
              -> Python pipeline
                -> Specialist features
                  -> Training
                    -> Forecasts
                      -> Target Zones
                        -> Dashboard wiring
                          -> Secondary pages
                            -> Auth
                              -> Monitoring
```
