# Indicator Review

Math, logic, and signal-value audit for ZINC Fusion V16 indicators and specialist features.

**When to invoke:** verifying indicator math is correct, checking whether an indicator adds real signal for ZL soybean oil forecasting, identifying overtooled or redundant features, auditing chart-side calculations, reviewing specialist feature logic, or assessing GARCH/Monte Carlo parameter choices.

**Does NOT:** train models, modify production data, or apply changes without explicit approval.
